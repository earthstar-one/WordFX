# Word FX

WordFX is in process to become federally recognized as a not-for-profit (501c3) already incorporated in VT | USA. 

Its mission is to provide low or no cost language resources and digital tools to enhance sense-making though global language disambiguation. 

The organization's language and technology resources and digital tools, unless otherwise specificed, are open to anyone anywhere on the planet. 

Participation, while wholly voluntary, is critical to WordFX having the meaningful impact it is designed for. 

Participation can take many forms:
- Contribute data in the form of WordFX-associated natural language tables
- Collaborate on adapting data so as to optimize capacity for interlinking (e.g. apply Wordnet standards) 
- Provide feedback on the accuracy of translations to other languages from original English
- Initiate translation to a natural language not yet documented in WordFX

To meaningfully sustain the aim of fruitful disambiguation, participation is always defined as efforts that maintain the consistent associative WordFX labeling of natural language fields as part of data storage, sharing, and interlinking. 

Early adopters are needed! Be in touch to learn more.
